Much of the Old World is covered in dark, forbidding forest. Although mankind has claimed this land, to think the forests are tamed would be a mistake - for they are the blood-grounds of the Cloven Ones. Beastmen are creatures of Chaos, so civilisation is anathema to them and they raid and destroy all that they come across. Mankind has retaliated, but bringing a warherd to battle is hard. Beastmen are master ambushers, using the beast-paths to entrap an enemy army - the hunter quickly becoming the hunted.<br>

Even when battle is joined, Beastmen are ferocious foes - mighty Beastlords control herds of goat-headed Gors, smaller Ungors strike from the flanks, and frenzied, massive Minotaurs charge at any enemy line. Then there are the many monsters in thrall to their bestial masters: Chaos Spawn, Warhounds, Giants and Cygors to name but a few. Such a fearsome menagerie is partly why the Old World's forests are still terrifying places, where the Children of Chaos roam, lurking in the darkness, desperate to pull apart the very fabric of civilisation.<br><br>
