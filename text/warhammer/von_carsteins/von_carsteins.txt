The Vampires have ever been a plague upon the living and none more so than the von Carsteins, an abominable bloodline of Undead nobles from the deathly realm of Sylvania. They inevitably strike out from this region at the head of a mighty Undead host - power-hungry Necromancers, Zombie hordes, ranks of Skeletons, tomb-skulking Crypt Ghouls and bestial Varghulfs are just some of the nightmares a Vampire Lord can summon to his indomitable will.<br>

Vlad may have been the first of the von Carstein line, but Mannfred was equally feared, finally being brought to bay at Hel Fenn and slain. But what is no longer living is never easy to kill; both Vlad and Mannfred have risen again. The dead have never rested easily in Sylvania and now they lurch from their graves, summoned to Unlife by the Midnight Aristocracy as each prepares to challenge mankind once more. Both believe they are the rightful, Eternal Emperor; the usurper, Karl Franz, will learn this at great cost - and all the living will pay tribute to the von Carsteins’ Unholy Majesty!<br><br>
