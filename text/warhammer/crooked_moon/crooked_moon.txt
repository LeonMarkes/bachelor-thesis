Although many Greenskin tribes reside in the Badlands to the south, since the calamitous defeat of the Dwarfs in the wake of the Time of Woes, Orcs and Goblins have developed a taste for the "fine livin'" to be found within the Dwarfholds - specifically the abundance of "shiny fings" piled high in the halls beneath.<br>

Now, the sneakiest Night Goblin, Skarsnik, self-styled 'Warlord of the Eight Peaks', hunts his prized Squigs in the Grey Mountains. Once he learns that mutinous gits from within his own tribe have betrayed him and taken the Eight Peaks for themselves there will most certainly be trouble of the psychotically-violent kind; Skarsnik's Waaagh! is truly something to behold, or avoid if you're on the opposing side! This is what Gork and Mork - da Green Godz - demand of their servants, and only total victory will satisfy their bloodlust!<br><br>
