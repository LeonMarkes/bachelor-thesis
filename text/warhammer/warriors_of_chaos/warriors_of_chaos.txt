The Chaos Gods have many names and aspects. For most in the Old World who are aware of such things, they are Khorne - the Blood God; Tzeentch - the Arch-Manipulator; Nurgle - the Lord of Decay and Slaanesh - the Dark Prince of Chaos.<br>

These Ruinous Powers have many mortal worshippers, most of which hail from the far north of Norsca and beyond. Their armies are legion, made up of barbarous Chaos Marauders and Chaos Warriors - particularly ruthless and bloody fighters gifted with arcane suits of all-encompassing armour, accompanied by a mass of mind-fraying creatures. These hordes can be raiders that cross the icy seas in longships, large armies that raze entire cities, or full-scale invasions where entire nations quake in fear, convinced the End Times are upon them... And quite possibly they are, for now is the time of the Three-Eyed King. Archaon the Everchosen gathers his countless servants, who are ready at their Lord's whispered command to bring doom to all!<br><br>
