As ever, the Dwarfs' reason for existence is to take back what is rightfully theirs and right the many wrongs recorded in the Great Book of Grudges. One such grudge is against that fiendish Night Goblin, Skarsnik, who will dominate Karak Eight Peaks unless challenged.<br>

As you might expect, Belegar Ironhammer - direct descendant of the legendary King Lunn - has taken this slight very personally indeed, and intends to set the record straight once and for all. In fact, so large a stain was the loss of Vala-Azril-Ungol upon the pride of Clan Angrund, that Belegar's ancient Ancestors refuse to rest until they have done their part to aid him in reclaiming the pivotal fortress for Clan Angrund and wiping out every nasty little green git who dares stand in his way.<br>

A tall order? Not really - Belegar has bolstered his army with a force of Rangers and some extremely serious hardware for smashing and bashing and flying his way to victory. That ought to do it, but if it doesn't he'll shave his beard off and join the Slayers! Mark Belegar's words, o green tide, and mark them well; the Karaz Ankor will return, with Belegar Ironhammer at its vanguard!<br><br>
