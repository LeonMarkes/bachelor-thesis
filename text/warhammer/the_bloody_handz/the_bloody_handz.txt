Traditionally, the Greenskins wander the Badlands as individual tribes, only coming together when the call to Waaagh! goes out. One such occasion is now; Wurrzag - aligned with the Orcs of the Bloody Handz tribe, who seek the greatness they believe 'Da Great Green Prophet' can bring them - is abroad, and has wandered into the Dragonback Mountains in search of more than just plunder and the inevitable scrap to get his filthy green hands on it.<br>

Wurrzag desires greatness for all his kind - for Greenskins to go beyond being merely an avaricious rabble and "reach for da skies". This will bring his force into conflict with other, potentially-sneakier Greenskins, plus bands of humies, stunties, and whatever-else dares get in their way. War is exactly what da Green Godz - Gork and Mork - want; they want it bloody and climactic, and they want it right now! And who is Wurrzag - most pious of all Orcs - to go against the word of da Godz? Exactly. Waaagh!<br><br>
