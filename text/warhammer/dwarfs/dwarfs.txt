For many generations the Dwarfs prospered. But then their realm was riven by a chain of devastating earthquakes followed by sustained attacks by Greenskins and other vile foes. Thus the golden age of the Karaz Ankor ended.<br>

To this day the Dwarfs still fight; their ultimate goal is to restore their empire. With their belligerence, such a thing is possible. A Dwarf throng is a powerful force, consisting of stoic Dwarf Warriors, Gyrocopters that fly above the battlefield and cannons fuelled by flame and steam that spew death. Dwarfs do not call upon the Winds of Magic in the same way as men. To them, magic is a tangible thing, something that can be worked into axes or cannonballs. It is with all these elements - stalwart Dwarfish hearts, exceptional armour and weaponry, and the unmatched machines of war - that High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer plans to retake his realm, slaying every last stinking Greenskin in his way! Few doubt his resolve and for the first time in many generations the Dwarfs are truly roused to battle - the Great Reckoning begins!<br><br>
