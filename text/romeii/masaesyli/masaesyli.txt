Before the kingdom of Numidia was founded its people were divided in two Berber tribes – the Massylii and the Masaesyli. Both groups were skilled warriors, who regularly settled tribal and inter-tribal rivalries through combat. However, the Massylii also had strong relations with Carthage, which is one of the main reasons why the Masaesyli may wish to align themselves with Rome should the opportunity arise. With the right allies, a Masaesyli king could transform his fledgling kingdom into a prospering African power of some note.<br>

On the other hand, as a powerful, warlike tribe, the Masaesyli are now faced with the opportunity to forge their own destiny, free from interference by the regional superpowers. They might seek to unite with their western cousins – the Gaetulians – peacefully or through other means, and an expansion to the eastern province of Phazania is also on the cards. Whichever route they choose, the Masaesyli's chief desire is the union of all the Berber peoples, so that they might build a fortress-nation of fertile north Africa.<br><br>
