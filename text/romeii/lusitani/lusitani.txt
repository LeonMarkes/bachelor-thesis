The Lusitani lived in Iberia long before Carthage and Rome disturbed the region. They are not a single clan but a confederation of smaller tribes, working together for defensive purposes and mutual gain. Although secluded in the west, the Iberian world has started to change; both Carthage and Rome are expanding into the region, and a violent clash is imminent. If they can secure their territory at home, there may yet be opportunities for the Lusitani to expand beyond the peninsula and out into the Mediterranean. There may be prudence in caution, even fraternisation, with the enemy, yet eventually all must fall before them!<br><br>
