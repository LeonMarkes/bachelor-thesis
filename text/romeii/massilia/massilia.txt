The Greeks formed their colony at Massilia around 600BC. Coming from Phocaea, they intended to harvest the region’s resources and trade from Massilia’s natural harbour. By the beginning of the 4th century BC, the former trading post had sprouted into one of the busiest ports in the Mediterranean, its tendrils even reaching up into Gaul along the Rhone and Durance rivers. Massilia is run as an oligarchy, an assembly headed by noble families. The population are a hybrid of Greek settlers, Gallic locals and others pulled to the city by trade. Despite a level of cultural integration, some Gallic tribes still see the city as a prize. Carthage, too, wants to control or destroy their trading rival. Both want Massilia’s great wealth for themselves, and will stop at nothing to take it.<br><br>
