Fearless warriors, the Celto-Germanic Nervii inhabit northern Gaul. Renowned for their bravery, these Spartan-like people eschew all luxuries, especially alcohol, which they believe make a person weak. Venerating the heroic warrior tradition, Nervii leaders are chosen for their martial prowess and wise leadership. As such, they prefer to launch ferocious, lightning assaults and ambushes, the better to earn glory and fame. Although friendly with their immediate neighbours, the Nervii have the skills and strength to push forward in any direction, even towards Rome and the civilised world to the south, where their fearsome reputation walks before them.<br><br>
