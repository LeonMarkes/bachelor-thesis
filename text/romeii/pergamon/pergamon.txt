Although a minor player up to that point, Pergamon came to prominence during Alexander the Great’s Successors' struggle for control of his fragmented empire. When Seleucus was murdered shortly after killing Lysimachus, the lieutenant Philetaerus controlled the fortress city, albeit as a protectorate of the Seleucids.

However, Pergamon is not yet a kingdom in the truest sense, and the time is right for expansion beyond its current borders.
