A civilisation of great builders who pioneered many construction techniques, the Nabataeans were the first to use cement extensively and build remarkable watertight reservoirs to ensure they always had the necessary supplies. They were also very literate and progressive people, who had remarkable gender equality considering the times in which they lived, even allowing women to participate in their political and religious life. Even if the Nabataeans were often threatened, as they were by powerful foes such as the Seleucids and Judeans, their progressive society allowed them to flourish and prosper.<br>

Nabataea is an important crossroads for the spice trade, serving as a conduit between the southern kingdoms that produced frankincense and myrrh and the wealthy eastern and western empires who were the primary buyers. Of course, preserving all this wealth at such a strategically important geographical location makes it essential that the Nabataeans maintain an army of well-trained troops and a strong navy. They have reinforced their excellent armed forces with their ability to adapt their environment to best advantage, making the capital of Petra an impregnable city as a result.<br>

Positioned on a strategic chokepoint between two strong empires, Egypt and the hostile Seleucids, has been quite challenging for the Nabateans; they could take a risk and seek a military resolution to the conflict with their rich Seleucid enemies or take the long road - solidifying their position before seeking expansion to the south, where the other, less organised Arabian tribes dwell, just waiting to be absorbed!<br><br>
