The Sabaean kingdom lies in the harsh lands of the southern Arabian Peninsula, but the inhospitable conditions haven't prevented these ingenious people from thriving. They've built dams, invented new irrigation techniques, and became experts in managing the scarce water of these dry areas. <br>

The Sabaeans are also very good sailors, with excellent trade relations with people living across the Red Sea, as the most important source of profit and wealth in Saba is the lucrative trade of frankincense and myrrh. As a nation of traders, farmers and engineers, the Sabaeans are not natural warriors, preferring to trust mercenaries to protect their trade routes and caravans. Having said that, they are highly-resilient, tough people who are formidable enemies of anyone daring to threaten their great capital city of Marib.<br>

Located at the southernmost part of the Arabian Peninsula, Saba has relatively secure borders to the south and west, accessible only by water. Their naval expertise could lead to expansion into Aethiopia. It might be wiser, however, to preserve the good trading relations that have been established with the people to the west, instead focusing on becoming the dominant power in the region by achieving a full monopoly on the spice trade that passes through Sabaean territory along the Silk Road.<br><br>
