Egypt is the oldest empire in the world. The Nile gave birth to its civilization and sustains the land still. When other empires are long forgotten, the monuments of Egypt will still awe lesser men. Now ruled by a Greek dynasty founded by one of Alexander the Great’s generals, Egypt remains what it has always been: rich, powerful, and influential. Every year the Nile renews the farmlands of Egypt. Every year the Pharaohs can be sure that their people will prosper, and reach out for new lands and new wealth. Egypt is a power of might, majesty and continuity.<br><br>
