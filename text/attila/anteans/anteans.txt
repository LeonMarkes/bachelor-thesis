Amidst a world in chaos, the Anteans hold fast between the mighty Prut and Dniester rivers. <br>

The Slavic tribes of the lower Danube were known to Roman historians by the 3rd century AD, and it is to them that the name 'Antae' or 'Antes' is attributed. Often considered to be an off-shoot of the Venedians, the Anteans nevertheless fought with savage fury themselves, forging both independence and an identity of their own. The Goths encountered them as they travelled west, fleeing from the rampaging, nomadic Huns, learning painfully of Antean aggression and tenacity - losing several brutal battles before capturing the Antean king and bringing the war to an abrupt, ignoble end. Ironically, the Anteans were saved from subjugation by the advancing Huns, who forced the Goths to continue their westward flight before they were able to establish total dominance. <br>

The dawning of the 5th century AD promises nothing but further chaos across Europe; the Huns continue to maraud whilst the Roman Empire braces against them, desperately hoping to hold back the tide, even making concessions to the so-called barbarians who have been their traditional enemies for many hundreds of years. Amidst this, the Anteans stand firm, determined to prove themselves strong, to emerge a unified Slavic power!<br><br>
