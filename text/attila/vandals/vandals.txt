Abandoned in their hour of need by their Roman allies, the Vandals find themselves at a turning point in their long quest for southern lands.<br>

This once-cordial relationship stretches back to the Marcomannic Wars, when the Vandals, who had recently invaded Dacia, were recruited as 'foederati' allies in the Roman struggle against barbarian uprisings. Rewarded with land in Pannonia, the Vandals peacefully co-existed with Rome for some time, and even integrated with the Empire to some extent. This enabled the rise of figures such as Stilicho, the half-Vandal who now rules the West through a puppet Emperor.<br>
