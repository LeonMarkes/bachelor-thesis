Descended from a noble, pure line of Slavic ancestors, the Sclavenians will see the Slavic people endure and prosper, through blood and battle! <br>

Roman historians divided the various Slavic tribes into Venedians, Anteans and Sclavenians, based on geography. The name 'Sclaveni' literally translates as 'land of the Slavs'. They were all, the Romans supposed, descended from the same tribe, eventually branching off into extended family groups or clans. The Sclavenians, in particular, were known to be an aggressive people who took advantage of the weakened and thinly-spread Imperial armies, raiding Thrace and Illyricum - intent on finding both loot and a place to settle. Inevitably, this drew the ire of the beleaguered, but nevertheless proud and mighty Roman Empire, who now work with rival tribes to combat Sclavenian incursions. <br>

The greatest powers of the world now fear them, yet as the 4th century AD ebbs away, the 5th promises further trials and unending challenges. Yet the Sclavenians are possessed of a fierce and irresistible temperament, showing time and time again that they are capable of mighty feats, and that the future will be no different!<br><br>
